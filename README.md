# Compiler-Project

# TECH USED: "PYTHON"

The following is the language we are trying to generate tokens and parse 

BEGIN 
  PRINT “HELLO” 
  INTEGER A, B, C 
  REAL D, E 
  STRING X, Y 
    A := 2 
    B := 4 
    C := 6 
    D := -3.65E-8 
    E := 4.567 
  X := “text1” 
  Y := “hello there” 
  FOR I:=1 TO 5 
    PRINT “Strings are [X] and [Y]” 
END

Todo:
generating a lex file in python
to create a parser for the tokens generated by lex
